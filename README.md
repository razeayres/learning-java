# My learning-java repository

This repository holds my training .java files. I created while attending to the course ["Java Essential Training for Students"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/java-essential-training-for-students/), which is a [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) course by [Peggy Fisher](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/peggy-fisher/). **I do not hold complete authorship of very line of code in these files, they are just a few results from my training**.
